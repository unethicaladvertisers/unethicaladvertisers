#### Unethical Advertisers

Unethical advertisers are those who advertise unethical ads for their own benefit to their viewers who are vulnerable.

Are you feeling helpless to see these unethical ads? We are too. We recently came across this hard hitting story of [Vijayakumar ](https://www.vikatan.com/social-affairs/crime/dont-be-addicted-to-online-gambling-games-says-vijayakumars-wife) who commited suicide due to the addiction of online gambling which is widely promoted by lot of online content creators. 

Hence, we started this project to create a leaderboard to shame the content creators who share unethical ads without due diligence.  Please join hands with us to track those unthical ads and to save the vulnerable people out there.
